Intended for use on a RPi but can run elsewhere

This is 2 parts PD and Python

Install!
- you need PD (sudo apt-get install puredata)
- you need the pythonosc module and to use Python3

Use!
- pop audio files in ./media
-launch PD  (command line no gui  "pd -nogui MIGHT_NEED_ABS_ADDRESS_here/OSC-audioPlayer.pd&" though you might need to set up audio the first time you do this so do that via a gui for the first time)
- set to in Python3

Documentation!
There are comments in the Python example

Good luck

Steve
